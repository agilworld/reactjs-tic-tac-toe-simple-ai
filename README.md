## Philosophy

The human must take AI & AI must under human.

## Explanation 

Please look up App.js and Board.js, especially board.js. Board.js is main of codes of the TicTacToe algorithm.
The game show board with consist of 9 squares, each sqaure has index number that number 0 starts at top left corner and number 9 ends at bottom right corner.

The game rule has 2 player, human player is marked by O sign and computer (AI) player is marked by X sign. Human player (us) must take start of the game and AI player responses moving of the human player until the board is fullfill and AI will choose a winner by combination of index numbers. The combinations are [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6].

The game has AI player with inteligentially checking empty indexes and put random index number. The second intelligence, it will broke the moving of opponent player in an effort to complete the combination of index numbers.
Based on Philosophy, the AI player no allowed to dominate any moves from human player, which means the AI player has few of winning chances from us ( human player ), perhaps will be categorized as an easy game.
